- [Foreach](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/foreach/index.html) - In C++, writing a loop that iterates over a sequence is tedious. We can either use iterators, which requires a considerable amount of boiler-plate, or we can use the std::for_each() algorithm and move our loop body into a predicate, which requires no less boiler-plate and forces us to move our logic far from where it will be used. In contrast, some other languages, like Perl, provide a dedicated "foreach" construct that automates this process. BOOST_FOREACH is just such a construct for C++. It iterates over sequences for us, freeing us from having to deal directly with iterators or write predicates, from Eric Niebler
  在C ++中，编写循环遍历序列的循环很繁琐。 我们可以使用需要大量样板的迭代器，也可以使用std :: for_each（）算法并将循环体移动到谓词中，这需要更少的样板并迫使我们移动我们的循环体。 逻辑远离将在何处使用。 相反，其他一些语言（例如Perl）则提供了专用的“ foreach”构造，该构造可自动执行此过程。 BOOST_FOREACH就是C ++的这种构造。 它为我们遍历序列，使我们不必直接处理迭代器或编写谓词。来自Eric Niebler

### Algorithms

- [Algorithm](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/algorithm/index.html) - A collection of useful generic algorithms, from Marshall Clow
- [Foreach](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/foreach/index.html) - In C++, writing a loop that iterates over a sequence is tedious. We can either use iterators, which requires a considerable amount of boiler-plate, or we can use the std::for_each() algorithm and move our loop body into a predicate, which requires no less boiler-plate and forces us to move our logic far from where it will be used. In contrast, some other languages, like Perl, provide a dedicated "foreach" construct that automates this process. BOOST_FOREACH is just such a construct for C++.
