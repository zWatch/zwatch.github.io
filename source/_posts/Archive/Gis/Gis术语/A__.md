It is widely used to enable geographic information to be shared by many users across a network and to scale in size from personal, to workgroup, to enterprise use.

ArcSDE administrative user
The user who administers ArcSDE geodatabases. The ArcSDE administrative user can be the SDE user, but for DBO-schema ArcSDE geodatabases in SQL Server it is any user whose login is mapped to DBO in the database, and for user-schema geodatabases in Oracle, the ArcSDE administrative user is the user in whose schema the geodatabase is stored.

ArcSDE client application
An application or program that communicates with ArcSDE to query, store and manage spatial data. Examples include ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Server, and ArcIMS.

ArcSDE database server
In ArcCatalog, an instance of SQL Server Express used to store ArcSDE geodatabases.

ArcSDE geodatabase
A geodatabase stored in an RDBMS served to client applications using ArcSDE technology. An ArcSDE geodatabase can support long transactions and versioned workflows, be used as a workspace for geoprocessing tasks, and provide the benefits of a relational database such as security, scalability, backup and recovery, and SQL access.

ArcSDE Personal Edition geodatabase
A single-user ArcSDE geodatabase that is created on Microsoft SQL Server Express.

ArcSDE system tables
A collection of tables that store metadata about user tables in a geodatabase managed using ArcSDE technology. ArcSDE system tables are owned by an ArcSDE administrative user.

ArcSDE Workgroup Edition geodatabase
A Microsoft SQL Server Express database that uses ArcSDE technology to store, query, and modify spatial data. Workgroup geodatabases accept up to 10 non-Web client connections and unlimited Web client connections to the SQL Server Express instance and are licensed through ArcGIS Server Workgroup edition.

arithmetic operator
The symbolic representation of a process or operation performed against one or more operands in an expression, such as ""+"" (plus, or addition) and "">"" (greater than). When evaluated, operators return a value as their result. If multiple operators appear in an expression, they are evaluated in order of their operator precedence.

array
In computing, a fundamental data structure consisting of a variable with multiple, sequentially indexed, cells that can each store a value of the same type. Each cell of the array acts as a variable, and the cells are referenced by an index value for each array dimension. One-dimensional arrays, called vectors, and two-dimensional arrays, called matrices, are most common, but arrays may have more dimensions.

artificial neural network
A computer architecture modeled after the human brain and designed to solve problems that human brains solve well, such as recognizing patterns and making predictions from past performance. Neural networks are composed of interconnected computer processors that calculate a number of weighted inputs to generate an output. For example, an output might be the approval or rejection of a credit application. This output would be based on several inputs, including the applicant's income, current debt, and credit history. Some of these inputs would count more than others; cumulatively, they would be compared to a threshold value that separates approvals from rejections. Neural networks ""learn"" to generate better outputs by adjusting the weights and thresholds applied to their inputs.

attribute query
A request for records of features in a table based on their attribute values.

attribute table
A database or tabular file containing information about a set of geographic features, usually arranged so that each row represents a feature and each column represents one feature attribute. In raster datasets, each row of an attribute table corresponds to a certain zone of cells having the same value. In a GIS, attribute tables are often joined or related to spatial data layers, and the attribute values they contain can be used to find, query, and symbolize features or raster cells.
