Users are often surprised when a reviewer says, “Don’t use the string concatenation operator, it’s not that efficient.” How can it be that `std::string::operator+` is inefficient? Isn’t it hard to get that wrong?

It turns out, such inefficiency isn’t clear cut. These two snippets have close to the same execution time, in practice:

```
std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string foobar = foo + bar;

std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string foobar = absl::StrCat(foo, bar);
```

However, the same is not true for these two snippets:

```
std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string baz = LongString3();
string foobar = foo + bar + baz;

std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string baz = LongString3();
std::string foobar = absl::StrCat(foo, bar, baz);
```

The reason these two cases differ can be understood when we pick apart what is happening in the expression `foo + bar + baz`. Since there are no overloads for three-argument operators in C++, this operation is necessarily going to make two calls to `string::operator+`. And between those two calls, the operation will construct (and store) a temporary string. So `std::string foobar = foo + bar + baz` is really equivalent to:

```
std::string temp = foo + bar;
std::string foobar = std::move(temp) + baz;
```

Specifically, note that the contents of `foo` and `bar` must be copied to a temporary location before they are placed within `foobar`. (For more on `std::move`, see [Tip of the Week #77: Temporaries, moves, and copies](https://abseil.io/tips/77).)

C++11 at least allows the second concatenation to happen without creating a new string object: `std::move(temp) + baz` is equivalent to `std::move(temp.append(baz))`. However, it’s possible that the buffer initially allocated for the temporary won’t be large enough to hold the final string, in which case a reallocation (and another copy) will be required. As a result, in the worst case, chains of `n` string concatenations require `O(n)` reallocations.

It is better instead to use `absl::StrCat()`, a nice helper function from [absl/strings/str_cat.h](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/str_cat.h) that calculates the necessary string length, reserves that size, and concatenates all of the input data into the output - a well-optimized `O(n)`. Similarly, for cases like:

```c++
foobar += foo + bar + baz;
```

use `absl::StrAppend()`, which performs similar optimizations:

```c++
absl::StrAppend(&foobar, foo, bar, baz);
```

As well, `absl::StrCat()` and `absl::StrAppend()` operate on types other than just string types: you can use `absl::StrCat`/`absl::StrAppend` to convert `int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint64_t`, `float`, `double`, `const char*`, and `string_view`, like this:

```c++
std::string foo = absl::StrCat("The year is ", year);
```
