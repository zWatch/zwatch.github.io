# EnTT

Welcome to the `EnTT` wiki. This is the place where you can find all the information about the library.

Please note that this is the documentation relating to the code available on `master` and **not** that generated for the last stable tag.
As for the latest stable release, refer to the online documentation. For all other tags, it's possible to generate the documentation starting directly from the code present in `EnTT`, as explained in the README file.

# Support

If you want to support this project, you can [offer me](https://www.paypal.me/skypjack) an espresso.
If you find that it's not enough, **consider becoming a sponsor**.
In both cases, you can help me make the difference.

## Hire me

If you start using `EnTT` and need help, if you want a new feature and want me to give it the highest priority, if you have any other reason to contact me: do not hesitate.
**I'm available for hiring**. Take a look at my [profile](https://github.com/skypjack) and contact me by mail.
